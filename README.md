## Model-Driven approach  
uses Model or the Component to perform all the logics in the Form 
  all the logics are written into the export class of the AppComponent

## Template-Driven approach 
uses the HTml template to perform all the logics.

# NOTE: 
both of the approach do the same-work, but the Model_Driven approach is Capable of implementing Complex logics into the Form.
and have better control as compared to the Template-Driven Approach.
